[Certificate](https://github.com/VINAYDA11061/Accenture_forage/blob/main/certificate.pdf)
#### My Role as a Data Analyst.
I recently participated in Accenture’s Data Analytics & Visualization job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a typical project team at Accenture, and to use Excel and data analytics and visualization skills in a realistic context.
•	Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture.
•	Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions.
•	Prepared a PowerPoint deck to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders.

### Tasks performed.

#### Task 1 - Understanding the Business requirements(Requirement gathering).
#### Project Details.
##### Client name: Social Buzz 

Client industry: Social media & content creation.
[Social Buzz](https://github.com/VINAYDA11061/Accenture_forage/blob/main/Client%20Brief.pdf)
               
              To start our engagement with Social Buzz, we are running a 3 month initial project in order to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following: 
              • An audit of their big data practice 
              • Recommendations for a successful IPO 
              • An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.
#### Task 2 - Data Cleaning & preprocessing.
So, the first step is to use this [data model[]()](https://github.com/VINAYDA11061/Accenture_forage/blob/main/Data%20model.pdf) 
to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
 - After Analysis we got data sets needed to complete analysis:
 >- Reaction Score(score is used to quantified the popularity)
 >- Content ID
 >- Reaction Types
 >- Content type
 >- Category
#### Data Cleaning
              •	removing rows that have values which are missing,
              •	changing the data type of some values within a column, and
              •	removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
**End result will be three cleaned data set :**
 - [Reaction Types]()
 - [Reactions]()
 - [Content]()

### Data Modelling:

**Create a final data set by merging 3 tables**

**End result will be one spreadsheet**
 - A cleaned dataset
 - Top 5 categories
 
 ### Cleaned Data set:
 So, the cleaned data set after data modelling & data cleaning :

#### Task 3 - Data Visualization & Storytelling
PowerPoint presentation that reports on the client’s content performance and deliver the insights of analysis.
 **Charts Created :**
  >- Pie Chart : Popularity Percentage share amoung Top 5 Categories .
  >- Bar Chart : sum of Score for category.
  
 - Powerpoint Presentation : [PPT]()
